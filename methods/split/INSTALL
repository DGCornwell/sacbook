This collection of programs and SAC macros implements the Silver and Chan (1991)
shear wave splitting measurement methodology.  You can also combine (stack) the
single estimates from a station or station neighborhood group to get a joint
estimate.  The stacking method used is Restivo and Helffrich (1999), which
differs from Wolfe and Silver (1998) in that it delivers more pessimistic
uncertainties (wider confidence bounds) but with a simpler methodology.  See
the references below for details on the respective methods.

The collection consists of:
1) The measurement program (shear_grh)
2) A SAC macro graphical user interface to the measurement program (split)
3) A stacking program (splstacksac)
4) A SAC macro interface to the stacking program (splitstack)

You need:
1) a Fortran compiler
2) SAC executable and library.

You also need a travel time calculator.  There are two choices:
  1) the Kennett and Buland tau-p travel time calculator, available
  as the program called ttimes.  See

    http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/sac-bugs.html#ttimes

  for source code for ttimes if you don't already have it.

  2) the Crotwell et al. Tau-P toolkit, available via

    http://www.seis.sc.edu/taup/index.html

There are two SAC macros of general utility used by split:
1) ttimes - annotate trace display with predicted phase arrival times.  Not
   restricted for use with split, but generally usable for any seismogram
   analysis procedure in SAC.
2) prompt - send message to terminal and ask for result.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) cd src

2) edit Makefile to indicate location of your SAC run-time libraries.  This
   will be different on every system except for MacSAC (see

   http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/sac-bugs.html

   ), where it will be in the file /usr/local/lib/libsacio.a (after the
   Installer puts it there).  Contact your local seismology programmer guru
   for advice.

3) make FC=gfortran shear_grh splstacksac

   or, if your Fortran compiler is g77,

   make FC=g77 shear_grh splstacksac

4) install binaries where your other seismology analysis programs live
   (somewhere listed in your search path).  If they normally live in
   ~george/seismo/bin, for example, then

   install shear_grh ~george/seismo/bin
   install splstacksac ~george/seismo/bin

5) cd ..

6) edit the SAC macros to indicate the location of the helper shell scripts.
   A good place for these to go is in the same directory as the SAC macros --
   that keeps the macro and its buddy together if you ever need to transport
   them or understand how they work together better.  Edit the files splitstack
   and ttsac and change the line reading

   $default macdir .

   or

   $default progdir .

   to wherever your SAC macros go, e.g.

   $default macdir /User/seismo/sacmacro

   Edit both splitstack, ttsac and split.

   Next, ensure the proper travel time calculator is used.  The file is
   ttsac.sh.  Edit the line reading "defttcalc" to make sure the proper
   default is selected (0 for ttimes, 1 for taup).

7) install the SAC macros in your SAC macro search path (see SAC's setmacro
   command).  If they normally are in ~george/seismo/sacmacro, for example, then

   install -c -m 644 split ~george/seismo/sacmacro
   install -c -m 644 ttsac ~george/seismo/sacmacro
   install -c -m 644 prompt ~george/seismo/sacmacro

8) install the (edited) SAC macro helper shell scripts in the SAC macro
   directory:

   install -c -m 755 splitstack.sh ~george/seismo/sacmacro
   install -c -m 755 ttsac.sh ~george/seismo/sacmacro

TESTING

The seismograms (SAC big-endian order)** are a test suite to show you how to use
the stacking methodology.  Fire up SAC.  Make sure your SAC macro path is set
properly to look for the split, ttsac and prompt macros.  Then make splitting
measurements for these four events in the current directory:

    bann.050400k.pks
    bann.060400d.skks
    bann.080300a.pks
    bann.080600b.sks

in SAC by issuing the commands:

  m split file bann.050400k.pks comps bhe bhn bhz
  m split file bann.060400d.skks comps bhe bhn bhz
  m split file bann.080300a.pks comps bhe bhn bhz
  m split file bann.080600b.sks comps bhe bhn bhz

The sequence of prompts that SAC will guide you through are self-explanatory.
(See comments about using more features of the split macro by reading comments
at the beginning of the SAC macro file.)  This will leave four files in the
directory with the suffix *.var.  These file names are what splstacksac uses
to make up the joint splitting estimate.  You put these names into a file and
then aim the splitstack macro at it.  The contents of BANN.stack already has
the named files in it:

  m splitstack file BANN.stack

and you should see the answer of 80+/-7 deg. and 1.0+/-0.25 s. as the splitting
estimate.  Lines in the splitstack input file beginning with "*" are comments
and are ignored by SAC and the processing program.  You might use this feature
to assess the relative importance of any particular datum to the result.

See comments in the SAC macro files for split and splitstack for documentation
on their use.

**If you are not on a big-endian machine and need to convert to little-endian
  to enable your SAC to read these files, see
  http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~george/sac-bugs.html

TROUBLESHOOTING

* SAC macro failures:
1) SAC2000 has a bug in macro processing (but not SAC/BRIS) which causes
   the some macros to fail.  In some versions, the last macro keyword on the
   $KEYS line is not properly recognized, and ttsac or split will fail by
   prompting you for a value for that keyword.  If you have this problem, add
   a dummy keyword to the end of the $KEYS line, like "bugjunk"  It will never
   be used by either you or the macro, so that solves the problem.  But getting
   a better SAC is a better solution!

2) SAC2000 does not implement the "previous" option for many commands.  If your
   SAC fails on these, comment out the offending line in ttsac and uncomment
   the one labeled "* SAC2000".

3) Some SAC2000 versions do not expand macro variables ($xxx$) on the $RUN
   command.  If yours does not, change the line with $RUN on it to substitute
   an explicit value for $macdir$.

4) Undefined symbols while compiling.  If you get a series of messages like
   these at the end of your compilation ...

   Undefined symbols:
     "_G77_stat_0", referenced from:
     _zinquire_ in libsacio.a(zinquire.o)

   this probably means that your Fortran compiler produces a 64 bit mode
   program and the SAC library is 32 bit.  To use the 64 bit SAC library,
   use

   libsacio-64.a

   in the Makefile where your SAC library location is specified.
